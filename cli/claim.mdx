## How Fees Work

Every time someone swaps your token on a DEX (e.g. Uniswap on Base):

```
Swap happens
     ↓
Clanker protocol fee deducted automatically
     ↓
Remaining fee split:
  90% → Your Creator Wallet  ← flows here instantly
  10% → DaiLaunch Platform Wallet
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fees are permanent and on-chain.** The split is encoded in the smart contract at deploy time via Clanker SDK — it cannot be changed after deployment.
{% endhint %}

## Export Your Wallet

To move your earned fees to another wallet, first export your private key:

```bash
dailaunch exportkey
```

Then import the key into MetaMask or any EVM-compatible wallet to access your funds.
