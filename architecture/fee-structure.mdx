# 💸 Fee Structure

DaiLaunch uses **Clanker SDK v4** to configure permanent on-chain trading fee splits at deploy time.

## How It Works

Every time your token is swapped on a DEX on Base:

```
Every Swap
     ↓
[Clanker Protocol Fee] — deducted automatically by smart contract
     ↓
Remaining fee split (configured at deploy):
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  90%  →  Creator Wallet (you)            │
  │  10%  →  DaiLaunch Platform Wallet       │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Configuration in Code

The fee split is set in `packages/api/src/services/clanker.ts`:

```typescript
const CREATOR_REWARD_PERCENT  = 90; // 90% → creator wallet
const PLATFORM_REWARD_PERCENT = 10; // 10% → DaiLaunch platform

rewardsConfig: {
  creatorReward:            CREATOR_REWARD_PERCENT,
  creatorAdmin:             creatorWallet,
  creatorRewardRecipient:   creatorWallet,
  interfaceAdmin:           PLATFORM_WALLET_ADDRESS,
  interfaceRewardRecipient: PLATFORM_WALLET_ADDRESS,
}
```

## Key Points

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Creator share | **90%** of every swap fee |
| Platform share | **10%** of every swap fee |
| Fee type | Permanent — encoded on-chain at deploy time |
| Changeable after deploy? | ❌ No — immutable by design |
| Claim method | Fees flow directly to wallet — no manual claim needed |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fees are permanent and trustless.** The split is encoded directly into the smart contract by Clanker SDK at the moment of deployment. Neither DaiLaunch nor anyone else can change it after the fact.
