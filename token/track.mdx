# 🔍 Track Your Token

After a successful deploy, your token is immediately live and trackable across multiple platforms.

## Where to Track

| Platform | URL | What You See |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **DaiLaunch Dashboard** | [dailaunch.online](https://dailaunch.online) | All DaiLaunch tokens, sorted by various metrics |
| **BaseScan** | `basescan.org/token/0x...` | On-chain contract, transfers, holders |
| **DexScreener** | `dexscreener.com/base/0x...` | Price chart, volume, liquidity, trades |
| **GitHub Repo** | Your auto-created repo | Token metadata, token-info.json |

## Market Data Tracked

The DaiLaunch indexer automatically tracks and updates the following in real-time:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Price** | Current token price in USD |
| **Market Cap** | Price × circulating supply |
| **Volume** | 24-hour trading volume in USD |
| **Liquidity** | Total liquidity in the DEX pool |
| **Holders** | Number of unique wallet holders |
| **Price Change 24h** | Percentage change over last 24 hours |

## Check via CLI

```bash
# See your token in the latest list
dailaunch status

# Check your earned trading fees
dailaunch claim
```

<Info>
It may take a few minutes after deploy for price and volume data to appear on DexScreener, as it depends on the first trade occurring in the liquidity pool.
